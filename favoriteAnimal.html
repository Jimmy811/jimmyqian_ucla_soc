        <p> snakes were a kind of animal thats not hard to tame, well at least my snake was not hard to be tamed, and you don't need to feed snakes alot of food every day,you just need to feed them once per week.</p>

        <p> But rabbits were not that kind of animal that only eats food once per week. Rabbits need a lot of vegetables per day,but they're cute.</p>

        <P>When I was 6 I really want a dog, but my mom doesn't allow me to have a dog,dogs were smart comparing to rabbits, thats why I like dogs.</P>
